# MacqueenDE

MacqueenDE is an independent Wayland desktop environment built around
**Macqueen**, a compositor derived from KWin and designed for first-class
integration with Quickshell.

The project is an alpha preview. It installs as a separate desktop session and
does not replace the system KWin package. Keep another working session
available while testing it.

## Install the Arch Linux binary preview

On Arch Linux x86_64:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyrka-meow/MacqueenDE/main/installer/install-github.sh | bash
```

Log out, select **MacqueenDE** in SDDM, and log in. The installer downloads a
checksummed GitHub Release into `/opt/macqueende`.

To uninstall while preserving user configuration:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyrka-meow/MacqueenDE/main/installer/uninstall-release.sh | bash
```

The repository keeps one rolling binary release. New builds replace the assets
inside the existing `rolling` release instead of creating release history.

## Project goals

- Keep the mature rendering, input, display, XWayland, and effects foundations
  inherited from KWin.
- Run independently from Plasma Shell.
- Provide a documented, versioned Macqueen IPC.
- Make Quickshell a first-class shell platform through a dedicated integration
  module.
- Ship MolniyaMacqueenShell as the reference desktop shell.
- Provide native screen sharing and remote desktop through
  `xdg-desktop-portal-macqueen`.
- Package and test the complete session reproducibly on Arch Linux.

## Development policy

The first milestone is a reproducible, nested development session. Macqueen
must not replace the system compositor during early development. Changes are
tested nested first, then in a separate TTY/session, and only later packaged as
a system session.

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and
[docs/UPSTREAM.md](docs/UPSTREAM.md). Local configuration and build
instructions are in [docs/BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md).

## Test in a window

From an existing KDE Wayland or Hyprland session, run:

```bash
./scripts/run-nested.sh
```

This opens a 1280x720 nested MacqueenDE session without replacing the host
desktop portal. Override the size with `MACQUEEN_NESTED_WIDTH` and
`MACQUEEN_NESTED_HEIGHT`.

## Start a direct development session

After building the compositor, Quickshell module, and Molniya backend, log out
of the current graphical desktop, enter a TTY, and run:

```bash
./start-macqueende
```

To add a separate `MacqueenDE` entry to SDDM:

```bash
./session/install-dev-session.sh
```
